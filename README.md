\# Kata Battle (Vercel + Supabase + Cloudflare Stream)



Create/join a battle by custom ID. Competitors and judges sign up. A judge starts a round: two competitors are chosen randomly, each uploads a kata video via a one-time link (no login). When both videos are ready, judges score 0â€“10 (0.1 steps). Highest total wins and the battle is archived.
